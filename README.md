# InventoryAI

InventoryAI is an advanced inventory management system that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize stock levels, predict demand, and streamline operations.

## Overview

InventoryAI integrates a Next.js frontend, a Node.js (Express) backend, and Python-based AI models within a monorepo structure to provide a seamless and efficient inventory management solution.

## Purpose

The primary goal of InventoryAI is to assist businesses in maintaining optimal inventory levels, reducing holding costs, and preventing stockouts by utilizing AI-driven demand forecasting and real-time inventory tracking.

## Functionality

- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: Monitor stock levels across multiple locations in real-time.
- **AI-Powered Demand Forecasting**: Predict future inventory requirements using machine learning models, including a time-series forecasting model built with ARIMA techniques.
- **Automated Reordering**: Set up automatic purchase orders based on predefined thresholds.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on inventory performance and trends.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive Next.js frontend for easy navigation and management.
- **Robust Backend**: Scalable Node.js (Express) backend handling API requests and business logic.
- **Advanced AI Models**: Python-based models for accurate demand forecasting.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Unified codebase for streamlined development and deployment.

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pnpm**: Install pnpm globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-huddle/InventoryAI.git
cd InventoryAI
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the dependencies for the entire monorepo:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running the Applications

Start the development servers for both frontend and backend:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**:

```bash
pnpm --filter web dev
```

2. **Backend (Express.js)**:

```bash
pnpm --filter backend dev
```

3. **AI Models (Python)**:

```bash
cd models
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, the backend at `http://localhost:5000`, and the AI models as configured.
